Directions.java:
	Sets a method thats orders an array of the list of instances of the class road and takes the input of an unorder list and lats and longs for to and from and will return the sorted list
		Will setup the disbetweenlat varible and then will set it to the postive number of the sum tolat - fromlat.

Postcodeinput.java:
	Method getcords that takes the inputs of a String for postcode and will return a String
		Will replace any spaces with a %20 allowing it to be used in an array
		Will make a String called url with a predefined start and the end being the Postcode url
		Will call the readdata and readwebsite methods with the inputs of the url
		Will set data to the inner result sections of the json file
		Will create and set a string called cords that will take the string vaule of the the lat and long of the postcode and this infomation is recived from the JSON file and will add " , " between the vaules so they can be spilt.

	Method readwebsite will take the input of the url and will return a string
		try
			Will start an inputstream to get the data from the URL that has been passed thought
			Will then create a reader so this data can be read
			Will create a Stringbuilder allowing us to add many strings together
			Creates a holder to hold the temp vaules
			while holder equal bufferedreader reading the next line is not equaling to null so there something there
				Add holder to stringbuilder
			next
			return the String of Stringbuilder
		catch An issue with the url
		catch an issue will the readers and streaming in data
